# ADORA Control-Flow Baseline

## Baseline

- Date: 2026-08-12
- Compiler commit: `4ef8fc6` (`DFG: tighten scalar input and DOT checks`)
- Experimental entrypoint: `experiment/jyhu/control-flow/run.sh all`
- Formal CDFG regressions: `check-adora-cgra-opt-cdfggen-control_flow_paths`, `check-adora-cgra-opt-cdfggen-gettanh`, and `check-adora-cgra-opt-cdfggen`
- Fixed input: hand-maintained MLIR paired with equivalent minimal C sources
- Frontend status: `cgeist` is not installed in the current environment, so C-to-MLIR is recorded as `SKIP`
- Mapper configuration: `test/spec/cgra_fp32/{cgra_adg_fp32.json,operations_fp32.json}` with `--max-iters=1 --timeout=10000`
- Generated IR, DOT, and logs: `experiment/jyhu/control-flow/out/` (ignored by Git)

The fixed MLIR path is authoritative for this baseline. C sources record the intended source semantics and can be compared with frontend output when `cgeist` becomes available.

This document preserves the original control-flow baseline at commit `4ef8fc6`. The current
branch has since completed the compiler/CDFG Stage A for conditional stores;
the updated status is summarized below and the hardware boundary is documented
in [`cstore-backend-audit.md`](cstore-backend-audit.md).

## Implementation at the original control-flow baseline

The normal `adoracc.py` path normalizes the input, extracts affine loops into `ADORA.kernel`, optimizes block access, and finally invokes `--adora-kernel-dfg-gen`.

Control-flow conversion is not a standalone pass. `generateCDFGfromKernel()` in `lib/DFG/DFGgen.cpp` mutates the kernel immediately before graph construction:

1. `lowerSCFIfToSelect()` collects every `scf.if` in the kernel.
2. Result-producing `scf.if` regions are lowered in postorder: non-yield operations are moved before the if and each yielded result becomes an `arith.select`. This keeps an inner select available before its enclosing select.
3. A result-less if containing stores is rewritten by store sinking:
   - a one-sided store becomes an old-value load, select, and unconditional store;
   - matching stores in both branches become one select and one unconditional store.
4. `InsertIselForLoopCarry()` subsequently inserts `ADORA.isel` for non-accumulation loop-carried values.
5. Captured integer and floating-point function-entry arguments, including `i1` predicates, are materialized once per function argument as synthetic CDFG `Input` nodes. Their stable metadata uses `<kernel>:arg<index>`, byte size `max(1, ceil(bitwidth / 8))`, offset `0,0`, and pattern `0,1`.
6. `GeneralOpName.txt` maps `arith.select` to `SEL` and `ADORA.isel` to `ISEL`. Every final `SEL` has false value at port 0, true value at port 1, and condition at port 2.

Important boundaries found by code inspection:

- Only `scf.if` has explicit if-conversion in the CDFG path.
- `affine.if` may be carried through kernel extraction, but has no corresponding conversion or operation-name mapping in CDFG generation.
- `cf.cond_br` is registered with the driver through the standard SCF-to-CF pass, but the `adoracc`/CDFG pipeline does not run that conversion and has no `cf.cond_br` graph mapping.
- `arith.select` is directly representable as `SEL`; nested SEL value-commit structure carries structured path semantics for every branch/body value commit, rather than adding a per-operation predicate annotation. Pure branch calculations may still execute speculatively.
- The false arm of each SEL is the single, compositional representation of predicate negation. Else-if and nested paths therefore compose through false/true SEL arms without a separate explicit NOT helper or repeated handwritten negation logic.
- `ADORA.isel` represents loop-carried state selection; it is not the general branch predicate representation.

## Formal control-flow results

The formal `control_flow_paths` lit regressions cover the four completion cases. Each checks that the rewritten kernel has no remaining `scf.if`, has the expected SEL count, and has connected captured predicate Inputs at SEL condition port 2. The DOT checks also reject undefined and CTRL opcodes.

| Case | CDFG path-condition evidence | Result |
|---|---|---|
| one-sided value-commit/store-sinking fixture | One SEL; old value -> port 0, true value -> port 1, captured `i1` -> port 2 | CDFG path shape PASS; not evidence of general conditional-store correctness |
| `if-else` | One SEL; captured predicate and scalar value Inputs, with false/true/condition ports 0/1/2 | PASS |
| `if-else if-else` | Two SELs; `b` feeds the inner condition, `a` the outer condition, and the inner result is the outer false value (port 0) | PASS |
| two-level nested `if` | Two SELs; `b` feeds the inner condition, `a` the outer condition, and the inner result is the outer true value (port 1) | PASS |

The focused target reported 4/4 passing tests. The required `gettanh` regression reported 1/1 passing, and the complete CDFG test group reported 9/9 passing. These are compiler/CDFG regressions, not mapper-placement claims.

### Path-condition conclusions

For the else-if case, the nested SEL structure is algebraically correct:

```text
select(a, S1, select(b, S2, S3))
S1 -> a
S2 -> !a && b
S3 -> !a && !b
```

For the nested case, the inner result is committed through the outer true arm, which represents `a && b` without requiring a separate branch-predicate dialect or an explicit AND node. Captured `i1` function arguments now reach the CDFG as reusable synthetic Inputs, so the required predicate edges are no longer disconnected.

The nesting expresses which value commits on each path; it does not make pure calculations control-dependent. Branch calculations that are safe to speculate can run before the SELs, while conditional memory operations require separate handling. At this baseline, the one-sided value-commit/store-sinking fixture verified only the generated CDFG path shape; it did not establish general conditional-store correctness.

## Known gaps and follow-up ownership

### Path conditions and control-flow correctness

- Structured `scf.if` result paths are represented by nested SEL commits, with captured scalar and `i1` function arguments feeding SEL condition port 2. The false SEL arm is the uniform negation representation, and postorder lowering preserves the required inner-to-outer ordering.
- Conditional load is still a known limitation: existing lowering/memory-footprint processing can make a load unconditional, and this baseline did not add a conditional-load representation.
- `affine.if`, `cf.cond_br`, switch, break, continue, and unstructured CFG remain out of scope and have no equivalent CDFG control-flow implementation.

### Current conditional-store status

- One-sided and different-address conditional writes now lower to
  `ADORA.cond_store` and CDFG `CSTORE`; same-address two-sided writes retain
  `SELECT + STORE`.
- Stage A CSTORE targets are statically shaped, identity-layout rank-one
  memrefs; layouts that need an extra offset or stride fail closed rather than
  being serialized with an incorrect byte address.
- CSTORE uses explicit `data=0`, `address=1`, and `enable=2` ports, complete I/O
  metadata, byte-scaled addresses, structured path predicates, conservative
  memory ordering, and transactional fail-closed generation.
- Legacy fp32/bf16 operation specs still lack `CSTORE`, and their ADG/IOB
  descriptions still lack a three-input I/O block with `UseEn`; those defaults
  remain unchanged. The ingestion phase adds an opt-in, tracked VITRA fixture at
  [`test/spec/cgra_cstore_vitra/`](../../test/spec/cgra_cstore_vitra/) from
  `MIONkb/VITRA-CGRA@15e432f83427fc3121c50e2d4832a76b86d7a64f` (operations
  SHA-256 `0eee215afdbed65fed6bd7773f40a783189d67a66accb6e7bc86aaac582bae8d`,
  ADG SHA-256 `e34fcef5b15f47718762812513d3cd7db35f06e60a17097e50429dfc41e26cf7`).
- The fixture's explicit IOB operations are authoritative and exactly
  `INPUT`, `OUTPUT`, `LOAD`, `STORE`, `CSTORE`; `CLOAD` is deliberately absent.
  Legacy mode-derived capabilities are used only when that field is absent, so
  the opt-in contract does not alter legacy defaults.
- With this fixture a direct loop-free CSTORE maps successfully with seeds 7,
  19, and 101 using fixed mapper parameters. Its dynamic data, byte-address,
  and enable chains have different producer depths. The pre-map CDFG has one
  CSTORE with logical inputs 0, 1, and 2; each route manifest has three CSTORE
  rows on disjoint physical input sets `{0,1}`, `{2,3}`, and `{4,5}`. Every
  input arrives at its target latency, at least one uses nonzero RDU delay, and
  repeating seed 7 produces a byte-identical manifest.
- A loop-free normal STORE maps with the same VITRA fixture without logical
  operand 2. A temporary ADG copy with CSTORE capability removed still maps
  normal STORE even when its legacy-style IOB also lacks the `UseEn` field and
  bit range; the same copy rejects CSTORE.
- The real `if_store` workload is distinct from the direct loop-free
  regression: it continues to fail in the stable, controlled way at `FOR is
  not supported!`. No FOR support is implied by the successful direct case.
- These mapper regressions prove placement, routing, input-latency alignment,
  and emitted configuration packet values. ADG-derived decoding checks
  CSTORE=`IsStore/UseAddr/UseEn=1/1/1`, normal
  STORE=`1/1/0`, INPUT=`0/0/0`, each selected physical input, and the packed
  DelayPipe lane delays against `mapped_routes.tsv`. `config.bit` and the
  generated `cfgbit_<kernel>` array agree exactly, including repeated seed 7.
  The current single-phase path is covered; runtime ping-pong switching and
  hardware execution are not. CLOAD remains absent and unsupported;
  conditional-store suppression on ADORA-generated hardware remains outside
  the validated scope.

### Mapper/spec limitations

- The selected fp32 operation file lacks `AND` and `SLT`; these mapper capability gaps remain recorded and are not bypassed by hardware-spec changes.
- A future mapper baseline should distinguish unsupported opcodes from malformed or disconnected graphs before reporting overall success.

## Reproduction

```bash
# Run all experimental cases. Stage failures are recorded without stopping later cases.
experiment/jyhu/control-flow/run.sh all

# Run one experimental case and replace summary.tsv with that single result.
experiment/jyhu/control-flow/run.sh if_elseif_else

# Formal control-flow and conditional-store CDFG regressions.
cmake --build build --target check-adora-cgra-opt-cdfggen-control_flow_paths -- -j1
cmake --build build --target check-adora-cgra-opt-cdfggen-gettanh -- -j1
cmake --build build --target check-adora-cgra-opt-cdfggen -- -j1
```

Each experimental failure is reproducible from the command log under its case output directory. The runner copies `input.mlir` before invoking `adoracc.py` because that driver cleans its MLIR input in place.

The runner is report-oriented: case-level `FAIL`/`SKIP` results are written to `summary.tsv`, but the command still exits zero after completing the requested cases. A nonzero exit is reserved for invocation errors or missing required infrastructure. Missing `cgeist` is a deliberate frontend `SKIP` and does not downgrade the fixed-MLIR Overall result; an installed frontend that fails does make Overall fail.
